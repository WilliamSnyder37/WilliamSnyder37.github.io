    <h1 style="text-align:center">THE MEAN TEACHER AND LINK</h1>
    <p>by Heath Snyder</p>
    <p>Link got very nervous and angry at the mean teacher.  When he looked at the mean teacher, he accidentally burnt a hole, with his eyes, in her left shoe. He has lazer eyes and an excellent arrow shooter. 
        Link got his super powers from his dad, Superman! Some kids make fun of link which causes him to get out of control and to burn things with his eyes </p>

    <p>The mean teacher asked Link what do you love? Link stated that he loves:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>fighting</li>
        <li>famly</li>
        <li>video games</li>
    </ol>
    <button onclick="getLocation()">get your location</button>
    <p id="demo">Link's current location is: </p>
    <script>
        var x = document.getElementById("demo");
        function getLocation() {
        if (navigator.geolocation) {
            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
        } else {
            x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
        }
        }

        function showPosition(position) {
        x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude +
        "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
        }
